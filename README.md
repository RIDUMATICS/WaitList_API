# WaitListAPI
As a developer at Dira Labs , you‚Äôre required to provide an API endpoint that helps people to join a waitlist. The waitlist would be able to accomodate two types of waitlisters:

Investors
Asset listers
Both waitlister types are required to fill in their details (full name and email address) while signing up.

However, the asset lister must provide a description of the asset they plan on listing. It should also be noted that no two waitlisters can have the same email address.

Create a backend application that exposes just a single endpoint and follows all business constraints stated in the problem statement.
